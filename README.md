# Final Project

For your final project, use the skills you've developed in this class to tackle a new problem. For example, you could develop a visualization for a complex dataset, construct a physicalization, visualize an algorithmic process, or run an experiment to explore graphical perception. Not many restrictions on this one other than it should demonstrate your mastery of the processes and ideas we talked about in class. Be creative and have fun!

You are welcome to work on this project as an individual or in a small group. I recommend keeping groups between 2-4 members, but am happy to discuss exceptions if you have a strong reason to prefer a larger team. 

You will be graded on both the artifacts you generate as part of this project and a project write-up and presentation. Expectations for the artifacts will be provided as feedback for your proposal. Details about the proposal, post-mortem, and presentation are available on Canvas. 

## Write-Up
You should approach the write-up like a research paper. It should contain the following sections:

* A 1-paragraph abstract that summarizes your motivating problem, what you did, and what you found.
* An introduction that describes the motivating problem and why it's interesting or important.
* A related work section that summarizes research related to your project (minimum eight citations).
* A detailed description of your project and justifications for any design elements.
* A discussion of what you found.

The write-up should be submitted as a PDF with a minimum of two pages (including figures and references) using the IEEE VIS Poster Format: <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>

## Deliverables
Please include any code, images of the artifact, and/or links to live deployments in your repository. You may provide links in the write-up, but should also include a copy of your code in this repository. If you choose to create a physicalization, your images and/or schematics should be part of the write-up but may also be included in your repository if you'd like to include a larger number of figures or other deliverables, such as a video walkthrough. 

## Submission
Final projects technically are due 11:59pm on 4.29 (our last day of class); however, you will have a no-cost extension until 5.5 at 11:59pm (the day that would otherwise be a final exam, which we will not be having). Note that due to University grading deadlines, late projects will not be accepted.

Please upload all deliverables through GitHub Classroom. This includes any code, data, documentation, or write-up. If you have physical artifacts, please either reach out to me to set up an appointment to present your artifacts or submit an explanatory video and/or set of photographs.
